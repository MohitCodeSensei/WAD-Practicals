  <h3 id="about">About</h3>
  <p>Valorant (stylized in all caps) is a 2020 first-person tactical hero shooter video game developed and published by Riot Games.[5] A free-to-play game, Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving. Development started in 2014 and was teased under the codename Project A in 2019; the game was released on June 2, 2020, for Windows. It was ported to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in June 2024, albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients. A mobile version, Valorant Mobile (Chinese: 《无畏契约：源能行动》[6]), launched in China on August 19, 2025, with a global release set at a later date</p>
